# Adopt-your-Bestie

"Adopt a Bestie" is a user-friendly web application designed to connect users with adoptable pets from our shelter. 
This platform showcases a diverse array of animals in need of loving homes, providing detailed profiles for each pet to help potential adopters find their perfect match. Additionally, the app includes a "Lost and Found" feature, aiding in the recovery of lost pets by allowing users to report missing animals and search through found ones.
